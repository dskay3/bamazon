Welcome to the bamazon application!
This node application will connect with a local SQL database to allow you to purchase items that are currently stored in your database.

Initial Launch:
- Displays a list of all items, price of each item, and quantity located within the database.

User Interaction:
- User (customer) will be shown prompts so that items can be purchased.
- When an item is purchased, the total amount and the remaining quantity of the item purchased in the databse will be displayed.
- If item is sold out, an error message will be displayed and the user (customer) will be given the opportunity to purchase a different item.

A demostration of this node application can be found in the following YouTube link or within the 'bamazonCustomer demo'.mp4 file:

Hope you enjoy!
Thanks!
